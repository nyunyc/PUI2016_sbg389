#PUI 2016 HW 2

##This directory contains the HW2 deliverables

This HW assignment was done in collaboration with colleagues form the PUI2016 Thursday Night Class.
The corresponding attributions are specified on each of the following sections.

## Assignment 1:  tracking each vehicle for a line

The deliverable for this assignment is a Python script that retrieves and reports information about active vehicles for a given bus line.

The script uses the MTA Bus Time Developer API (http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/Index) and receives two parameters:

    The API Key (necessary to make calls agains the service)
    The Bus Line itself
  
The API is based on the SIRI Standard (Service Interface for Real Time Information http://user47094.vs.easily.co.uk/siri/) 
The MTA allows developers to sign in to obtain an API key that enables querying the interface with a quota of 2 calls per mminute

In order to obtain the specific information that is needed to craft the desired script output, we had to explore the result using the guidance of the SIRI
